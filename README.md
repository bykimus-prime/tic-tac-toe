# tic-tac-toe

A tic tac toe game playable in your browser. Like previous Odin Project projects, uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A special focus of this project is to store the gameboard as an array inside of an object. Players will also be stored in objects, and flow of the game will be in an object. As such, module patterns and factory functions are a focus.

Additional highlights are rendering gameboard array to webpage, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker, logic to check when game is over, a start/restart button, and congratulate the winning player if there is no tie.
